This is a [b]demo[/b] mod for modders to make their key bindings UX better.

Comparing to vanilla mod options, how does it improve user experience:
[list]
[*]Click on option to popup a dialog, then just press the key you want to bind.
No more endless switching between options.
[*]Beside mod options, also support hot-rebind in "Settings > Controls".
[b]No need of restarting game.[/b]
[/list]

What keys does it support:
[list]
[*]Almost all of the keys including number pad
[*]Mouse middle button and two side buttons
[/list]
